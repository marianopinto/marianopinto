### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Mariano and below you can find some info about me:

- Iâ€™m mostly focused on testing and, as part of that, I really enjoy coding. Golang is the language that I've been exploring recently and I really like it. 
- I'm always willing to grasp new skills and I find the DevOps practices very interesting.
